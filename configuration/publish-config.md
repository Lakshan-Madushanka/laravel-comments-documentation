# ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡´ Publish Config

### Publish config file

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=lakm/configs
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You don't need to explicitly execute the above command, as the package publishes it when you run the [comments:install](../basics/installation.md#step-2) command during installation.
{% endhint %}

The above command publishes the package's config file, named **comments.php**, into the project's config directory.
