# 🌍 Localization

The default language of the package is English. However, you can localize the package to any language you wish, as we use Laravel's localization syntax for accessing words.

All the localizable words list can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/Lakshan-Madushanka/47ae8fefff00468427458c817d52c7d0).

```
// lang/es.json
{
    'Create' => 'Crear'
}
```

Consult [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/localization) for learn more about localization.
